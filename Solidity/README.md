# How to Learn Solidity

### This is a document that includes all that you'll need to get started with the solidity programming language based on Ethereum platform.

It is a summary of the [Medium blog by *Robbert Vermeulen*](https://medium.com/@robbertvermeulen/learn-solidity-the-ethereum-smart-contract-programming-language-7f106fc26d6), and he did a great job in collecting all good resources online to learn Solidity. Here I extract all the core information we need, so we can get started to learn solidity in one click, have fun in learning!

1. The most direct *goto* is the [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/)
2. If you don's have any experience in ECMAScript2016 (ES6), or mostly known as JavaScript, you can finish this [top 10 features tutorial blog](https://webapplog.com/es6/), and check the [ES 6 cheatsheet](http://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/)

> ###Learn Solidity — The Ethereum smart contract programming language
*In the course of time that I am involved in Ethereum development, I have noticed that not much information exists yet to learn Solidity (outside of the Solidity documentation).*

> I have saved the information that I found in the meantime and the goal of this article is to share all my gathered resources, so other people new in this world don’t have to search, but can start learning Solidity immediately.
